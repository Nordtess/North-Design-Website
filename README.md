# 🕵️ North Design: Where Cybersecurity Meets Corporate Espionage

**"We don't just protect your data—we monetize it."** A satirical frontend masterpiece masquerading as a corporate website for the world's most ethically questionable cybersecurity firm. Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS Grid wizardry, and questionable morals.

</div>

## 💡 Description

I built North Design as a university frontend project that perfectly demonstrates how to create a professional, multi-page business website while simultaneously roasting the entire tech industry's data privacy practices. It's a parody website for an imaginary cybersecurity company that's hilariously, unapologetically evil—think "what if a security firm was actually harvesting everything they promised to protect?"

But beneath the satire lies **serious frontend engineering**. This isn't just comedy—it's a showcase of modular CSS architecture, vanilla JavaScript mastery, and clean code practices that would make any senior developer nod in approval (before questioning their life choices).

### My Core Technical Contributions:

**Since this was a group project, here's what I personally architected and implemented:**

- **🎨 Entire Design System & CSS Grid Template:** Created the foundational black-and-white minimalist theme and built the complete responsive CSS Grid system that powers every page. Think of it as the skeleton that everyone else hung organs on.
- **✅ Advanced Form Validation Engine:** Implemented the contact form with real-time validation featuring visual feedback (red/green glow effects), regex pattern matching for names/emails/phone numbers, and `event.preventDefault()` logic to block submissions when validation fails. No backend? No problem—the UX is so smooth you won't even notice.

- **🎭 Complex JavaScript Animations:** Built custom interactive elements including a mouse-tracking circle that follows your cursor (demonstrating event listeners and DOM manipulation), animated project cards with scroll-triggered reveals, and smooth transitions that make the page feel alive.

- **📦 Dynamic Data Handling with Axios:** Integrated Axios to fetch and render project data from JSON files dynamically. Includes filtering, sorting (A-Z/Z-A), and live search functionality—all without a single database query.

- **🗂️ Project Architecture & File Structure:** Organized the entire codebase with modular CSS/JS files per page, centralized template files for shared components, and clean separation of concerns. Future maintainers won't want to hunt me down—probably.

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

This is a static website with zero dependencies (unless you count Axios, which is loaded via CDN). Just open it in a browser and you're good to go.

### Option 1: Simple File Open

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nordtess/North-Design-Website-main
cd North-Design-Website-main

# 2. Open index.html in your browser
open index.html  # macOS
start index.html  # Windows
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
```

### Option 2: Local Development Server (Recommended)

If you're testing dynamic features (like Axios requests), you'll want a local server to avoid CORS issues:

```bash
# Using Python 3 (comes pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js (if you have it installed)
npx http-server -p 8000

# Or using PHP (if you're feeling nostalgic)
php -S localhost:8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## 🔧 Technical Deep Dive

### Form Validation System

The contact form features a comprehensive validation engine that runs on every input change:

```javascript
// Real-time validation with visual feedback
function validateName() {
  const name = $nameInput.value.trim();
  const nameRegex = /^[a-zA-ZÅÄÖåäö\s'-]+$/;

  if (name === "") {
    $nameError.textContent = "Please enter your name";
    return false;
  } else if (!nameRegex.test(name)) {
    $nameError.textContent = "Name can only contain letters";
    return false;
  } else {
    $nameError.textContent = "";
    return true;
  }
}

// Prevent submission if any field fails validation
$form.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  const validations = [
    validateName(),
    validateNumber(),
    validateEmail(),
    validateMessage(),
  ];

  if (!validations.every((v) => v === true)) {
    e.preventDefault(); // Block the submit!
  }
});
```

**Key Features:**

- Input fields change color based on validation state (red = error, green = valid)
- Error messages appear below each field with specific feedback
- Submit button is only functional when all validations pass
- Swedish character support (Å, Ä, Ö) for international usability

### Dynamic Data Fetching with Axios

Jamie's project showcase demonstrates asynchronous data loading and client-side filtering:

```javascript
let projects = [];

// Fetch JSON data using Axios
axios.get("/data/projects-david.json").then((response) => {
  projects = response.data;
  render(projects);
});

// Live search filtering
filterInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
  const searchText = filterInput.value.toLowerCase();
  const filtered = projects.filter((p) =>
    p.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchText),
  );
  render(filtered);
});

// A-Z sorting
sortAZ.addEventListener("click", () => {
  render([...projects].sort((a, b) => a.title.localeCompare(b.title)));
});
```

**Why This Matters:**

- Demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript (Promises)
- Array manipulation methods (`filter`, `sort`, `map`)
- DOM rendering patterns without a framework
- Immutable data handling (spreading arrays before sorting)

### CSS Grid Mastery

The entire layout system uses CSS Grid for responsive, maintainable layouts:

```css
/* Responsive grid that adapts to screen size */
.employee-area {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
  padding: 2rem;
}

/* Mobile-first approach */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .employee-area {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 1.5rem;
  }
}
```

**Grid Advantages:**

- No floats, no positioning hacks, no flexbox gymnastics
- Automatically responsive with `auto-fit` and `minmax()`
- Clean, declarative layout code
- Consistent spacing with `gap` property

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Minimalist Black & White Theme

The entire visual identity is built on high contrast and negative space:

- **Typography:** Google Fonts' Poppins for clean, modern readability
- **Color Palette:** Pure black (#000), pure white (#FFF), subtle grays for depth
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Size, weight, and spacing instead of color
- **Accessibility:** Maximum contrast ratio for readability

### Satirical Copywriting

The website's text is intentionally absurd to demonstrate how corporate speak can be weaponized:

> _"We envision a future where no data goes unharvested, no cookie remains untracked, and no embarrassing late-night search history is left unsold."_

This juxtaposition of professional design with ridiculous content showcases how presentation can dress up any message—a meta-commentary on modern tech marketing.

## 🚀 What I Learned

Building this project taught me:

- **Vanilla JavaScript is Underrated:** Frameworks are great, but understanding DOM manipulation, event delegation, and async patterns without abstractions is fundamental. You can build complex UIs without React.
- **CSS Grid vs. Flexbox:** Grid is superior for page layouts, Flexbox shines for component-level alignment. Using both appropriately makes responsive design trivial.

- **Form Validation Best Practices:** Client-side validation improves UX but should never replace server-side validation (which this project doesn't have, because satire doesn't need a backend).

- **Code Organization Matters:** Splitting CSS/JS by page while maintaining a shared template system makes collaboration easier. Group projects don't have to be messy.

- **Performance Without Frameworks:** Zero build tools, zero bundlers, zero dependencies (except Axios CDN). The entire site loads in milliseconds because there's no framework overhead.

## 📝 Future Enhancements (If I Had Infinite Time)

- [ ] Backend integration for actual form submissions (Node.js + Express?)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (ironic for a website already this dark)
- [ ] Intersection Observer API for smoother scroll animations
- [ ] Service Worker for offline functionality (because evil never sleeps)
- [ ] Lighthouse score optimization (aiming for that sweet 100/100)
- [ ] Internationalization (evil deserves to be multilingual)
- [ ] Animated SVG illustrations for employee profiles
- [ ] More parody projects in the JSON database
